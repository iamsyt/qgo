Compiling and Installing
____________________

> qmake
> make
(and then as root:)
# make install

If you get an error about /bin/lrelease you can usually fix it by doing
> export QTDIR=/bin
before doing make install

On Mac Systems, there's a line in src.pro: 
QMAKE_MAC_SDK = /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk
You may have to change this to MacOSX10.5.sdk or something else depending on
where those libraries are installed.

You may also need to do
> cd src
> qmake src.pro
> make
