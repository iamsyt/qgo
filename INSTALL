Some additional notes
____________________

make and make install issues haven't really been fixed yet so here's some hints.

If you want sounds, you have to copy them to /usr/share/qgo2/sounds or run qgo
from the sounds directory.
If you want to use a translation, you'll need to run lrelease src.pro and then
run qgo from the translations directory.

cd src
qmake src.pro
make

May also work.  

On Mac Systems, there's a line in src.pro: 
QMAKE_MAC_SDK = /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk
You may have to change this to MacOSX10.5.sdk or something else depending on
where those libraries are installed.
